# Assignment 1: 30mff website - "Getting Ready For Zoom"
**Project Description**

**Getting Ready For Zoom** was a short film produced in thirty minutes as a part of the second Communications Lab lecture of summer 2021. This project is a website showcasing the short film, with the intention of creating a realistic-yet-mocking backstory. The film itself is anything but serious, and my intention was to communicate that through a website that used the elements and conventions of real film website but whose aesthetics and content expressed the very unprofessional nature of the film. As well, I wanted to represent some elements of Zoom in the website, like the gallery camera view, and recognisable UI items like the microphone and signal bars.

**Process**

I first looked at the elements that make up a _credible_ short film website. I took these from the sites of shorts [Motorway 65](https://motorway65.com/) and [Me and my Moulton](http://www.mikrofilm.no/Me-and-My-Moulton). This made me come up with a set of requirements that would make the website _credible_: it should include the characters' stills and descriptions, fake festivals the movie has been selected for, praises from fake reviewers, and a short synopsis. 

While the _realistic_ part of the website was attempted through the general elements included, the _mocking_ part of the website was created through its colour scheme, typography, and content. Given that the film is about a university class, I intended the look of the website to resemble a notebook: this is why I chose a simple colour palette of white (representing paper), black and blue (common body and accent pen colours, respectively), and a handwritten font. The dotted pattern of the background also resembles that of some notebooks, while not being as visually intrusive as a ruled or grid pattern. To further communicate the _unprofessionality_ of the film, the content of the website and the descriptions of the character are **nonsense**: I made logos for four fake film festivals, invented backstories for the actors, and embellished the synopsis and teaser with added conflict.

Regarding the positioning of the elements, I wanted to emulate the gallery view of Zoom calls. I did this by **over**using the `display:grid` environment, including some media queries to adapt the size of the grid to smaller screen sizes. I also added icons and names of reviewers and castmembers as they would appear on Zoom: as a small box in the corner of the image. This also gave me the opportunity to add some interactivity to the site: the first view the user encounters in some of the pages is a grid of photos, but when hovering the mouse over them the user can discover an extended description. This allowed me to enter more information into the site without affecting the simple Zoom-like layout.

**Evaluation**

Most of my expectations were met by the process. Although the website doesn't boast complex animations and over-the-top interactive elements, I think it achieves the goal of creating a light-hearted, simple experience. There are some tiny loose ends in terms of alignment and text sizing - I hope to get better at those with time!
