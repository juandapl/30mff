            <p style="text-align: justify;">Since I saw a post in Instagram this morning about them, I have come up with very diverse and interesting thoughts about otters. They look like a badly-made combination of a dog and a seal. However, unlike dogs, they are not very fond of being pets. Moreover, unlike seals, they have legs. In this picture, two otters are replicating that scene from Titanic where Rose floats on a plank to survive. The light-coloured otter was awarded an Otter Oscar for playing the plank.</p>
